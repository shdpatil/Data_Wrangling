 # Nano-Degree-Data-Analyst
This is the 3rd project for the Udacity Data Analyst - Nanodegree. I was tasked at choosing any area of the world from 
https://www.openstreetmap.org and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for<li> validity,</li><li>accuracy,</li><li>completeness,</li><li>consistency and</li><li>uniformity</li>   
to clean the OpenStreetMap data.
I chose the Miami City, which is my favourite region. Python was used to clean and audit the data and creating a json file and
prepare it for inserting into the NoSQL database: MongoDB. Many  MongoDB queries were then run to arrive at interesting findings. Basically I run queries to check the amenities like restaurants, place of worship, schools etc. Then I run queries to check the total no of postal codes. I also run queries to check the total no of users contributing to the site, who were the top contributors, who were the least contributors. I also discussed about how to increase the number of the users contributing to the openstreet.org site, by using various methods so that more information can be uploaded on the website.
